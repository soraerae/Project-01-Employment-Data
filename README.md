Background: My goal was to look at employment trends over the past decade broken down by industries and determine what were the fastest growing industries, what were the industries in decline, and if they challenged my assumptions (which they did!)

Initially, I wanted to pull data from their API because I thought it would be an easier method of collecting multiple years of data than getting CSVs/Excel files. However, that proved difficult due to a) kept hitting rate limits on pulls and b) once pulled, I had difficulty getting the right data into neat and nice dataframes.

I eventually found the excel files that broke down yearly data by industry, so I downloaded them all and began reading them into Dataframes.

The data eventually challenged my assumptions. I discovered that Manufacturing was a growing industry and in the top 10 industries since 2011. Additionally, I learned Education and healthcare were in the top 10, which I really didn't think were growing industries.
